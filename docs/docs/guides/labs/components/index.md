Welcome to Dagster Components.

Dagster Components is a new way to structure your Dagster projects. It aims to provide:

- An opinionated project layout that supports ongoing scaffolding from "Hello world" to the most advanced projects.
- A class-based interface (`Component`) for dynamically constructing Dagster definitions from arbitrary data (such as third-party integration configuration files).
- A toolkit for building YAML DSLs for `Components`, allowing instances of components to be defined with little to no Python code.
- A Dagster-provided set of component types that provide a simplified user experience for common integrations.

## Installation

To use Dagster Components, you must use `uv` to install the `dg` command line tool. The `dg` tool allows you to quickly scaffold Dagster projects and populate them with components. `dg` is designed to be globally installed and has no dependency on `dagster` itself.

### 1. Install uv

First, install the Python package manager [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which will be used to install a globally available `dg`:

<CliInvocationExample contents="brew install uv" />

:::info Windows or Linux installation

To install `uv` on Windows or Linux, see the [`uv` installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### 2. Install the dg command line tool

Once you have installed `uv`, use it to install `dg`:

<CliInvocationExample contents="uv tool install dagster-dg" />

:::note

`uv tool install` installs Python packages from PyPI into isolated environments and exposes their executables on your shell path. This means the `dg` command will always execute in an isolated environment separate from any project environment.

## dg API reference

Below is the help message for `dg`, which also serves as the API reference:
